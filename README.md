# About
This is a simple toy project vibecoded with Claude in about 30 minutes.
I also did some UX fine tuning and bugfixing afterwards, and also manually added Grok support

It allows you to send messages to multiple AI models concurrently and compare their responses.

My goal was to experiment with vibecoding and see if how easy it is to understand and conventionally iterate generated code.

## Dependencies

- NodeJS

## Usage

Clone the repo and enter the directory

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open the app in browser `http://localhost:3000/`


## TODO
* Conversation support (currently there is no overarching session)
